# org.civicoop.protectedfromaddress

This extension protects the use of a personal from address in the Send E-mail takas (after search).
It does not protect the use of personal from address in CiviMail (Mass mailings). 

Its developed for use within CVVE where volunteers log into CiviCRM and have their own personal e-mail adress, such as
hotmail etc., and they want to send an e-mail from the system using the orgisational e-mail address. 

## User story

As a user I want to send an e-mail to contacts in the system and I want to 
use the info@cvvede.nl e-mail address and don't want to use my private email address joe@hotmail.com.
So that all e-mails are send from info@cvvede.nl and are delivered through the mail server of the organisation
and replies will also go back to cvve.
